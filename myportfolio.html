    <p>I am Nyipoji Kani Jibarang, the fourth of five chidren. I am a student in the University of Jos studying Mechanical Engineering. I am a student also at Codevixens Academy studying Frontend Html and CSS. I am a tech enthusiast as I love to women about tech and love to indugle them in tech activities. I love to volunteer to assist non governmental organizations to make less privilleged people smile. In 5 years time, i have envisioned myself as a global tech enthusiats and give back to my society by training ladies and the younger generation tech skills. I live in plateau state so I would love to have a physical branch of codevixens her in Plateau state so as to enable girls to learn even when they do not have personalised laptops.</p>
    <h4>Thank You</h4>
